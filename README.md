# Title: SOLAR PIEZO HYRBID POWER CHARGING SYSTEM

## Abstract

The Solar-Piezo Hybrid Electric Charging System presents an innovative solution for sustainable energy harvesting by integrating solar photovoltaic panels with piezoelectric transducers. This dual-source architecture addresses the limitations of intermittent solar availability by supplementing energy generation with kinetic inputs from environmental vibrations, pressure, and human activity. Solar panels serve as the primary energy source during daylight, while piezoelectric sensors ensure continuous power capture under dynamic conditions. A charge controller efficiently regulates energy flow to a rechargeable battery, safeguarding against overcharging and optimizing storage. System operations are managed by an Arduino-based microcontroller, which also facilitates real-time monitoring via an LCD interface. Designed for deployment in urban infrastructure such as smart roads, pedestrian walkways, and public charging stations, the system supports reliable charging of electric vehicles, portable electronics, and IoT devices. Experimental validation confirms enhanced energy efficiency, reduced dependence on grid electricity, and improved accessibility in remote areas. This hybrid approach underscores the potential of integrated renewable technologies to advance green infrastructure and promote eco-friendly power solutions.

## Conclusion

The Solar Piezo Hybrid Power Charging System showcases a practical approach to combining solar photovoltaic and piezoelectric technologies into a single, efficient platform for sustainable power generation. By integrating solar panels with piezoelectric sensors, the system captures both sunlight and kinetic energy, storing it in a rechargeable battery. A microcontroller-based unit intelligently manages energy flow, prioritizing solar input during daylight and switching to piezoelectric sources during low-light conditions or periods of high pedestrian activity.

Prototype testing confirmed that solar energy serves as the primary power source, while piezoelectric elements provide supplementary input that enhances system resilience, especially in adverse weather. The hybrid setup successfully powered low-voltage applications such as LED lighting, IoT devices, and mobile charging stations, making it well-suited for smart city infrastructure and urban environments.

The expected outcome of this project is a reduction in dependence on grid electricity, improved energy accessibility in remote or underserved regions, and the promotion of eco-friendly, cost-effective power solutions. With future enhancements—such as more efficient piezoelectric materials, scalability for higher loads, and smarter energy management algorithms—the system holds promise for broader implementation and impact.
