# Title: SOLAR PIEZO HYRBID POWER CHARGING SYSTEM

## Abstract

The Solar-Piezo Hybrid Electric Charging System presents an innovative solution for sustainable energy harvesting by integrating solar photovoltaic panels with piezoelectric transducers. This dual-source architecture addresses the limitations of intermittent solar availability by supplementing energy generation with kinetic inputs from environmental vibrations, pressure, and human activity. Solar panels serve as the primary energy source during daylight, while piezoelectric sensors ensure continuous power capture under dynamic conditions. A charge controller efficiently regulates energy flow to a rechargeable battery, safeguarding against overcharging and optimizing storage. System operations are managed by an Arduino-based microcontroller, which also facilitates real-time monitoring via an LCD interface. Designed for deployment in urban infrastructure such as smart roads, pedestrian walkways, and public charging stations, the system supports reliable charging of electric vehicles, portable electronics, and IoT devices. Experimental validation confirms enhanced energy efficiency, reduced dependence on grid electricity, and improved accessibility in remote areas. This hybrid approach underscores the potential of integrated renewable technologies to advance green infrastructure and promote eco-friendly power solutions.
